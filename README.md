# ContactsAPI
A RESTful API using Jersey and JAX-RS to manage a contact list with basic details like email, phone number, and gender. It supports multiple MIME types and full CRUD operations, integrating MySQL for data retrieval, storage, and modification. It follows best practices by organizing the project into distinct modules: DAOs for data access, entities for domain models, filters for request handling, providers for services, resources for REST endpoints, and utility classes for shared functionality. 
This API was tested using Postman.
